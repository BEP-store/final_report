\section{Specification}
It appears that GitHub already implements most of the features needed as specified in the problem analysis. The resulting platform should therefor be an extension to the GitHub platform so it can also be used by non-developers. In the research report a MoSCoW model was proposed \Citep * [chap. 5.5]{research-report:v1.0}

\subsection{Requirements}
MoSCoW

\subsection{Success critera/Use Cases}
% Maybe split this into formal/informal?

\subsection{Definition of Done}
Iets over ons eigen platform gebruiken om zichzelf te ontwikkelen.


\section{Implementation}
% issue 11
Complete description of the final product. %plus graphics

% FlowChart

% UML Diagram

% Plaatje van uiteindelijke platform (?)
